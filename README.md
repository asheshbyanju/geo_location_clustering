# Geo Location Clustering
GEO-LOCATION CLUSTERING USING THE k-MEANS ALGORITHM

We approach the clustering problem by implementing the k-means algorithm using PySpark and ML library.

The Data contains information collected from mobile devices on Loudacreâ€™s network, including device ID, current status, location and so on. Loudacre Mobile is a (fictional) fast- growing wireless carrier that provides mobile service to customers throughout western USA. K-means clustering can be used to determine the information like where a new cell tower can be installed for maximum coverage or where the maximum number of users are.
